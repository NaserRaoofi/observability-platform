- **`k8s/base/alertmanager/notification-templates.yaml`** - Rich email notification templates
- **`k8s/base/alertmanager/kustomization.yaml`** - Kustomize configuration with HA clustering
- **`k8s/base/alertmanager/README.md`** - Complete documentation and architecture diagrams

### Grafana Integration

- **Updated `k8s/base/grafana/values.yaml`** - Added AlertManager datasource
- **`k8s/base/grafana/dashboards/alertmanager-overview.json`** - AlertManager monitoring dashboard
- **`k8s/base/grafana/dashboards/slo-monitoring.json`** - Unified SLO and alerting dashboard

### Infrastructure Integration

- **Updated `k8s/base/kustomization.yaml`** - Added AlertManager to main deployment

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Features

### High Availability

- **3-replica AlertManager cluster** with automatic failover
- **Cluster mesh networking** for alert synchronization
- **Persistent storage** with automatic recovery

### Intelligent Routing

- **SLO-specific routing** by severity (critical, high, warning)
- **Infrastructure alert routing** by component
- **Security alert escalation** with email notifications
- **Inhibition rules** to prevent alert storms

### Email Notifications

- **SMTP Integration** - Professional email notifications with TLS encryption
- **Template-Based** - Rich HTML emails with SLO context and error budget information
- **Multi-Recipient** - Different teams receive relevant alerts based on severity and type
- **Reliable Delivery** - Clean configuration focused on email-only notifications

### Rich Email Templates

- **SLO templates** - Error budget, burn rate, service context in structured email format
- **Infrastructure templates** - Component health, resource usage details via email
- **Security templates** - Incident details, remediation steps through email alerts
- **General templates** - Standard alert formatting for consistent email notifications

## üîó Integration Points

### Sloth SLO Integration

```yaml
# SLO alerts automatically route to AlertManager
- Alert severity mapping (critical, high, warning)
- Error budget context in notifications
- Burn rate calculations and trends
- Service-specific routing rules
```

### Grafana Visualization

```yaml
# AlertManager datasource configured
- Real-time alert status display
- SLO dashboard with alert integration
- AlertManager metrics and performance
- Unified observability view
```

### Mimir Metrics Integration

```yaml
# AlertManager metrics scraped by Mimir
- alertmanager_alerts (active/suppressed alerts)
- alertmanager_notifications_total (notification volume)
- alertmanager_notifications_failed_total (failure rate)
- alertmanager_cluster_members (HA status)
```

## üéÆ Operational Features

### Alert Management

- **Grouping** - Related alerts grouped by service/component
- **Silencing** - Temporary suppression during maintenance
- **Inhibition** - Automatic suppression of redundant alerts
- **Email Delivery** - Reliable SMTP-based notification delivery with rich templates

### Email Notification Channels

```yaml
Critical SLO Alerts:
  - Email: sre-oncall@company.com (immediate delivery)

High SLO Alerts:
  - Email: sre-team@company.com

Infrastructure Alerts:
  - Email: infrastructure@company.com

Security Alerts:
  - Email: security@company.com (immediate delivery)

SLO Warning Alerts:
  - Email: slo-monitoring@company.com

General Alerts:
  - Email: alerts@company.com
```

### SLO Alert Workflow

1. **Sloth** generates PrometheusRule based on SLO definitions
2. **Mimir** evaluates rules and sends alerts to AlertManager
3. **AlertManager** routes alerts based on severity and service
4. **Email notifications** sent to appropriate teams with rich context and templates
5. **Grafana** displays unified view of SLOs, alerts, and metrics

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Observability namespace exists
- Sloth SLO definitions configured
- Notification channel secrets created
- Grafana datasource updates applied

### Deployment Command

```bash
# Deploy AlertManager
kubectl apply -k k8s/base/alertmanager/

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n observability -l app.kubernetes.io/name=alertmanager

# Check AlertManager UI
kubectl port-forward -n observability svc/alertmanager 9093:9093
```

### Verification

```bash
# Check AlertManager status
curl http://localhost:9093/-/ready

# View active alerts
curl http://localhost:9093/api/v1/alerts

# Check cluster status
curl http://localhost:9093/api/v1/status
```

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics

- **Alert Volume**: `rate(alertmanager_alerts_received_total[5m])`
- **Notification Success**: `rate(alertmanager_notifications_total[5m])`
- **Notification Failures**: `rate(alertmanager_notifications_failed_total[5m])`
- **Cluster Health**: `alertmanager_cluster_members`

### Dashboard Views

- **AlertManager Overview**: Instance health, alert volume, notification rates
- **SLO Monitoring**: Error budgets, burn rates, active SLO alerts
- **Alert Table**: Real-time view of all active alerts with filtering
